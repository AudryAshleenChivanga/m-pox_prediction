M-Pox Outbreak Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood and spread of M-Pox (Monkeypox) outbreaks in specific regions using machine learning. The model leverages historical outbreak data, environmental factors, and demographic information to provide insights that can help public health officials take preventive measures and allocate resources effectively.

Data
Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from the following sources:

Infection Data:
Historical M-Pox outbreak data from WHO and CDC.
Environmental Data:
Climate data (temperature, humidity) from National Meteorological Services.
Demographic Data:
Population density and healthcare infrastructure data from World Bank and UNICEF.
Wildlife Data:
Zoonotic data on wildlife populations from various research papers.
Data Structure
The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the recorded data.
Location: Geographic location (city, country).
Number of Cases: Number of M-Pox cases reported.
Temperature: Average temperature in the region.
Humidity: Average humidity level.
Population Density: Number of people per square kilometer.
Healthcare Access: Measure of healthcare accessibility (e.g., number of hospitals per 100,000 people).
Wildlife Interaction: Proximity to wildlife habitats.
Installation
Prerequisites
Installations:

Python 3.7 or higher

Model
Model Selection
We experimented with several models, including:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
The final model was chosen based on its performance on the test data.

Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The ability of the model to correctly identify positive cases.
Recall: The ability of the model to find all relevant cases.
F1-Score: A balance between precision and recall.
Results
The model achieved the following results on the test data:

Accuracy: 85%
Precision: 80%
Recall: 75%
F1-Score: 77%
These results suggest that the model is effective in predicting M-Pox outbreaks, but there is room for improvement in terms of recall.
